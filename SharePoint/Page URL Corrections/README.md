# Page URL Corrections
# WARNING: Alpha Script - Currently in Testing

## Description:
- This script has been recently built in an attempt to dynamically identify site pages within a tenant that have their URL's misconfigured to the appropriate site; thus, preventing access.
- This script is still in alpha and should be used cautiously till furhter testing can be conducted.
- This script is also not entirely feature rich yet as I prefer and is a test of the core functionality prior to addition of features such as logging.
